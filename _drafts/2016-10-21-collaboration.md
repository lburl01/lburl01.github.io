### Being Part of a Team

I love working on teams. It's one of the things that fulfills me most and energizes me best. I love working with like-minded people and navigating the challenges of multiple brains is exhilarating.  One of the greatest luxuries of being at The Iron Yard is that pretty much everyone else around me shares the passion and single-minded devotion to a project.

We've now had two inter-class projects between my back-end class and the Front End Engineers. The first was on week 4, maybe, and the last one was last week. Both times I've been lucky to have really great team members and we seemed to get along as well as could be hoped for.

It was definitely two different experiences and there are a couple of things I'd like to remember from each one as we head into the world of our final projects and working with a team for three weeks straight.

**Group Project 1**

This project was Movie Lens (aka shitty Netflix) and we were tasked with creating a program that could take some open source data on movies and user ratings and spitting out that information based on user input and MAYBE even generating a recommended list of movies based on a user's ratings. (I don't think anyone got that far - which stinks because it would be awesome to say I figured out how to implement Euclidian Distance!) Both of our classes had already done a similar program (and I had done movie lens twice - the ever-perfectionist I am) so that was super helpful to have a fairly strong starting point.
