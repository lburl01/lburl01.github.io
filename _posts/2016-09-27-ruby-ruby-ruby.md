So, I had that moment this week. Where my brain was overwhelmed and the homework assignment was *really hard* and I just didn't know what to do to move just one tiny step forward on it.

It was not a great moment, but definitely a great learning experience. I think what I remember reading most on many previous Iron Yard students' blogs was their emotional journey just as much as their technical experiences. Because when you're outside of The Iron Yard, and you're peering in through the peephole of a blog post, it's really hard to imagine spending 10-12 hours a day in a basement, staring at a computer, and cramming so much information into your brain that who knows what's falling out the other side.

But, it's truly what happens. I can't remember what we learned on Monday, and it's Thursday. Yet somehow this weekend project that's assigned Thursday evenings, require me to take everything we've covered (rather briefly) in lecture and then expand that knowledge in about 10 different ways on one assignment. Oh, and you probably haven't encountered many of the required functionality yet!

This weekend project was the epitome of Ruby and all we've learned. And boy was it a tough one. Our instructor had amped up the project quite a bit saying his previous Python students had really struggled with it and not even completed the Normal mode completely. (Most of our homework assignments have Normal, Advanced, Epic, and Impossible modes. Normal is "required" and the rest is the cherry on top.) The Python students also mentioned how much they hated the project...so we were all shaking in our boots about how to tackle this assignment.

<blockquote>And yet, I really felt like I "got it".</blockquote>

When we reviewed the code and everyone's progress after the weekend, I realized that I could do a lot of refactoring to improve the functionality, efficiency, and just mastery of Ruby. BUT...I completed the minimum requirements! I could read in a huge 100,000 line CSV file! And I could pull information out of it! WHAT?! Super proud of myself. Especially since I completed this assignment without access to wi-fi. (Thanks, <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a>, for storing all the Ruby Docs on my computer! Great, free, computer app for apprentice programmers.)

So, Week 2 recap? I think I can call myself a Rubyist. I can give you a program that will let you play blackjack, hangman, or see the average ratings for a movie. I mostly understand that functions have to return something, I can use classes (under duress...but I'm working on it!), and my mastery of git, github, and the command line feels realllllly good. Pretty good progress for two weeks of sitting in a basement!
