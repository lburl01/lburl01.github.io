<p><strong>Panic Level:</strong> 2 out of 6</p>
<hr>

Whew. Another week has passed. Next week we'll be one-third of the way through the program. Which is insane to think about. In some ways, it feels like I just started yesterday and other ways I feel like I know so much for only three weeks of learning.

Today, we were given the in-class assignment of reflecting on our three weeks. I know this is what I mostly talk about in blog posts already, but I wanted to use a more curated question base to think purposefully. So, here we go!

**What have you learned? What do you feel good about having accomplished? What do you feel you understand well? What are you proud of?**

I've learned how to make Ruby bend to my will (most days) and use a computer programming language to create something that does something. I can help you learn to play blackjack or find a movie recommendation based on movie ratings.

I feel good about how comfortable I am being uncomfortable. Our instructor commented before he left for the day how it seemed like we were all in a good place (AKA not panicking about the weekend project). He asked if it was because we had a Ruby project again and we were glad to be done with Javascript or what. Many people agreed that yes, they were happy moving back to solid, safer ground. But for me, my first thought was just, "I'm not freaking out about the assignment because I know it'll be hard, but I'll also make progress on it." I've just moved on to a point where I don't feel that panic setting in because I know that's just a phase masking my feelings of not fully understanding a topic and expecting myself too...before I've even learned it!

I think I excel fairly well in writing concise functions and keeping the main function clear. I'm proud of my diligence on understanding homework assignments that are difficult and continuing to work on them even after their due date. I have at least two "pet projects"
 that are previous assignments I have started over on completely to test myself, my understanding, and what I've learned since that assignment was assigned. I think this method has strengthened my overall understanding of how these many topics are knit together differently across many projects.

**What questions do you have? What confuses you? What do you feel weak on? What do you wish you knew more about? What still doesn't make sense?**

Classes are still the bane of my existence! I understand them rationally (AKA outside of the program) but fitting my functions and variables into classes is still a challenge. For some reason my brain does not accept their categorization and referencing abilities. Every project now I'm trying to utilize classes to just get more working experience and brain muscle memory on how they work together with larger programs utilizing multiple files.

As for things I wish I knew more about - everything! 50% of my time away from school I find myself thinking about how I just wish I knew more about X, Y, or Z. There are so many things we've learned and in some ways we've only scratched the surface of all those topics. And I know that's kind of the point of The Iron Yard - that they can't make us experts - but as a perfectionist, it's challenging to balance knowing that I can't know everything about everything at this point in my career. Leaves me plenty to strive for.

**How have you been managing the insanity that is learning programming with your todo list of programs, homework, reading, video watching, life, etc?**

I've mostly lowered my expectations about how much I can get done in a day. Which means that "reading" is only really a page or two a night. And video watching doesn't happen consistently. I'm lucky that I have a husband who helps manage the adulting for me (Thanks, Peter!) and that gives me more time to buckle down on homework, and that ever-persistent reading assignment.

One thing I do find really annoying is that I'm dreaming about coding in a very specific way each night. I don't sleep very soundly and find myself woken up because my brain is working on my homework assignments and the things I was struggling with on it and then my brain will wake me up with an idea or solution and it happens to be 2AM. Which is very inconvenient, brain! I also had a bizarre dream last night where my cell phone was hacked by 2,000 lines of code in the span of 30 seconds. I'm not really sure what that means other than coding has taken over my life!

**In Conclusion...**
I can't imagine doing anything else. I asked my husband how I could keep feeling like this forever - so motivated and passionate, and open to everything and anything. I can only hope to find an awesome job where living a life full of curiosity and discovery is required.
