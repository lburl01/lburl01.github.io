So, this week was a bit of an easy ride for me. (At least 50% of it was!) Week 3 is all about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In my last job, I managed the website and had led two website redesigns. We used content management systems both times (the first was Wordpress, the second was a very similar proprietary version) and I learned the ins and outs of HTML through that experience.

As for CSS, well, I didn't have to manage that. I just helped design what the CSS would contain and that was that. Thankfully I set the time aside to set up this blog and that created a really good foundational knowledge of CSS and let me challenge myself during this week at school to improve on the initial design.

So, what did I learn so far? Well, I had a really good foundational knowledge of Bootstrap, so I chose to not install that on my site and instead use Skeleton to get some increased responsiveness for different screen sizes. That was an interesting learning process since I had previously only referenced one CSS file at a time. I definitely had a little mix-up with the order of my stylesheets! (You'd think the "cascading" part of CSS would have clued me in...)

Today, Thursday, we had the assignment to build a static webpage that used Javascript to change the user interface when an action was performed. On that page I used Bootstrap since it has JQuery built in and challenged myself to use at least one button, one dropdown, and one input field and then create reactions based on those objects.

I think my project came out really cool so far! Javascript has some of the most interesting functionality to me...but since doing the CodeSchool Javascript course 5 months ago, looking at the functions was *really* hard to pick up again this week. Want to see my project? <a class="post-link" href="https://lburl01.github.io/adventures-in-js/">Find it here.</a> At this point in time, I still need to go back and add functionality to the input fields and add a final "slide". Hopefully by the time someone else is reading this, I'll have already done that!

Overall, I'm still really enjoying my time at The Iron Yard. It's been interesting to see my mindset change in the last three weeks as I encounter new vocabulary, new concepts, new methods of writing previously understood topics, and more.

I've definitely had a few days where I feel so behind the other students or like I'm just not getting it...whatever "it" might be. But I'm working hard to encourage my brain to be curious about what I'm doing instead of getting frustrated; and that's really been key.

We talk about Imposter Syndrome a lot...but I think I more often just feel behind. Like I'm not putting the concepts together fast enough or taking what we've learned and applying it in ten different ways as I'm "supposed" to. So I'm practicing being okay with not knowing. Some things are just unknowable to me right now and only experience will get me over the hump into the valley of understanding. I've just got to keep taking one step at a time and trust my instructor (who's awesome) and brain that one day it will make more sense!
