First post using <a class="post_link" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a class="post_link" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>. Very surreal. Probably should have been working on more Rails and Ruby tutorials! (But let's be honest - making things pretty is a great distraction.)

Took our instructor's advice and used Github pages for this blogging thing to really stretch my understanding of working in the command line, in the raw folders and files, and to just learn something new. Who needs that crutch, Wordpress, amiright?

Alright, so I guess I should introduce myself. I'm in my mid-20s, have two dogs, a husband, and love bright colors. I recently quit my job at a science museum so I could pursue something I really love doing - problem solving with the help of technology. I led two website redesigns at my previous job and as tedious, frustrating, fascinating, exhilarating, and challenging as it was, I just couldn't leave the excitement for once every five to ten years.

So here I am, 8 days away from beginning the adventure of The Iron Yard in Ruby on Rails. I'll be part of Cohort 8 at the Durham campus and can't wait. I've learned so much from alumni and previous instructors that I just want everything to begin. I'm pretty sure after reading tons of great student blogs from around the country that I'll probably need a nap in 9 days...but where's the fun in that?

And now a quote that I'm going to claim as my tagline for this 3-month adventure:

<blockquote>Run with scissors.  Walk with erasers.</blockquote>
