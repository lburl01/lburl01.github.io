<p><strong>Brains</strong><p>
<p>I'm not sure my brain has ever been so "on". I mean, I'm an overachiever/perfectionist and always have been. So not with almost no boundaries on what I can try to make happen, my brain is in overdrive. I have a hard time falling asleep and getting my mind to turn off. My alarm goes off at 6 and immediately my brain's on again. Thankfully I have ways of distracting it like biking with my dogs or going for a morning walk, but I already long a little for sleeping in.</p>

<p>That said...I LOVE this feeling. While insanely challenging, I've never felt more proud of or engaged in my work. Understanding a concept is definitely like the iconic lightbulb moment and "failing" leaves me with more of a "Huh, that's interesting" response than frustration. I can't wait to get our first weekend assignment today! I wonder what challenges it might bring and what new knowledge I can stuff in my brain.</p>

<p><strong>Grateful</strong></p>
<p>Almost done with week one and I'm feeling lots of the feelings. I've been in touch with my previous coworkers who, while missing me (and I them!), are so supportive of me taking this leap and making things happen for myself and my career. Which is just so nice. It makes leaving so much more bittersweet, but in the best possible way.</p>

<p>I also can't go without feeling loads of gratitude for my parents and husband, family members, and my own previous hard work and diligence. Without all of that, I wouldn't even be able to be here, doing this really amazing three month adventure. It takes a lot of support to quit your job, find new health insurance, not have a paycheck, and basically derail your life for three months. (I definitely have already made the mistake of overcommitting to my social life this first week!) This is not a cheap journey, or one without an impact on those around you. But I'd like to think - and hope - that it will create long term benefits for everyone around me and not just myself.</p>

<p>Can't wait to make everyone proud on graduation day!</p>
